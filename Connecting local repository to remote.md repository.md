# Connecting a local repository with a remote repository
Local repositories are present individual project member’s computers, while the remote repositories are hosted on a server that is accessible to all the members.
There are very few commands to interact with a remote repository on git. It's also very important to note that almost all modifications have to be made and committed locally first before uploading them on a remote. Remote repositories are only thought as a means for sharing and exchanging code between developers and not for actually working on files.
There are two ways to linking a local repositor with a remote one – 
## From remote:
Here we use Git Fork command, used when the repository is already available on GitHub. We make a git fork or git clone of the repository on the local location. 
A GitHub fork is a copy of a repository (repo) that sits in your account rather than the account from which you forked the data from. Once you have forked a repo, you own your forked copy. This means that you can edit the contents of your forked repository without impacting the parent repo.
We can fork any repo by clicking the fork button in the upper right-hand corner of a repo page. Its name should be: `<our-user-name>/<repository-name>`



## From local:
This is done by the Git Remote command, here the repository is first created on local and then the user connects it to the remote repository.
 A git remote command is used to make the remote connections such as connecting a Git local repository with GitHub remote repository.
1.	Open your Git Bash and navigate to the repository that needs to be linked.

2.	Check if the repository is clean and there is nothing outstanding by using git status command.
```
$git status
```
3.	Execute the git remote command.
```
$git remote
```
Since there is no linked repository, no output was received from Git.
4.	Now, with the help of the URL given above, we will link the repository. To link a repository, execute the following command and press enter:
**Note: The above command follows the generic syntax of `git remote add  <name>  <repository url>`**
```
git remote add Project1 https://github.com/dscciem/Pentesting-and-Hacking-Scripts.git
```

add: To add a new URL to the repository.
name: To give a name that you will use instead of the URL of the repository.
URL: The URL of the repository.
We can get the URL from the main page of any repository, by clicking on the green `code` button. The URL used here is of GSSOC project pentesting and hacking


##How to check if the Local Repository is connected with Remote Repository?
To check weather the repository is linked or not execute ` git remote` command
```
IN:   $git remote 
OUT:  Project1
```
We can use `git remote -v` to see the URL along to.

## PR request using remote
Using the local version of repository, it is way easier to submit a pull request (PR). 
1. Start by creating a new branch for the feature or bug fix. Giving a Remember giving a descriptive and good name. You can simply use `add file` button on the site or type the command
`git checkout -b added-config-type-to-mu-config`
2. Once the contribution is ready, the new branch can be pushed to the remote repository of the forked library. For example, see these commands.
```
           git add -A 
           git commit -m “Added config type to module unification config”
           git push origin added-config-type-to-mu-config
```
**Note: that by pushing to origin and appending the new branch name it will automatically create a matching branch on Github before pushing the files.**
3.	Submitting a pull request – Make sure that we are using the right branch then use the `New pull request` button.
