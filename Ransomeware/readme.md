The FileMonitor class is defined to encapsulate the monitoring functionality. It initializes with the specified directory and creates data structures (file_sizes, file_hashes, and file_last_modified) to store file information.

The start_monitoring method is called to start the monitoring process. It first performs an initial scan of the directory by calling the initial_scan method.

The monitoring is performed by a separate thread (monitor_files). It continuously scans the directory for any modifications in files. If a file is modified (its size is different from the recorded size), the handle_file_modification method is called to determine if it's potential ransomware activity.

The handle_file_modification method calculates the hash of the file and compares it with the recorded hash. If the hashes differ, it checks the time difference since the last modification. If the time difference is less than 10 seconds, it considers it potential ransomware activity and calls the detect_ransomware method.

The detect_ransomware method is responsible for taking appropriate actions to mitigate the impact of potential ransomware. This can include isolating the infected system, terminating processes, alerting administrators, etc. You can customize this method to implement your specific response actions.

The code also includes a periodic analysis thread (periodic_analysis) that runs every 60 seconds. It removes any file entries from the data structures if the corresponding file no longer exists.

The calculate_file_hash method is used to calculate the SHA256 hash of a file. It reads the file in chunks and updates the hash object accordingly.

The code uses a lock (self.lock) to ensure thread-safe access to the shared data structures.

In the main part of the code, the directory_to_monitor variable specifies the directory path to monitor for ransomware detection. You can modify this variable to monitor the desired directory.

An instance of the FileMonitor class is created with the specified directory, and the start_monitoring method is called to initiate the monitoring process.
