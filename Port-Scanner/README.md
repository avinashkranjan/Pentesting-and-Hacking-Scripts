   "Description":"W32.Beagle.AO@mm [Symantec-2004-080911-3251-99] - mass-mailing worm with backdoor functionality. Uses its own SMTP engine, discovered 08.09.2004. Opens port 80 tcp & udp. W32.Bobax.AF@mm [Symantec-2005-081611-4121-99] (2005.08.15) - a mass-mailing worm that opens a backdoor and lowers security settings on the compromised computer. It exploits the MS Plug and Play Buffer Overflow vulnerability (MS Security Bulletin [MS05-039]) on port 21/tcp., and by sending copies of itself to gathered email addresses. Also opens a backdoor on a random tcp port and/or port 80/udp. Siemens SINEMA Server before 12 SP1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (web-interface outage) via crafted HTTP requests to port 80 (TCP/UDP). References: [CVE-2014-2733] Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in the integrated web server in Siemens SINEMA Server before 12 SP1 allow remote attackers to access arbitrary files via HTTP traffic to port (1) 4999 or (2) 80. References: [CVE-2014-2732] Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in the integrated web server in Siemens SINEMA Server before 12 SP1 allow remote attackers to access arbitrary files via HTTP traffic to port (1) 4999 or (2) 80. Reference: [CVE-2014-2731] Port 80 udp is also used by some games, like Alien vs Predator (Activision)."
