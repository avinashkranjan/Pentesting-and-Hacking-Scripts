# Web application scanner

Automated Vulnerability Detection: The script automates the process of scanning web applications to identify common vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Command Injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and more.

-Security Assessment: It helps assess the security posture of web applications by identifying weaknesses and potential entry points that attackers could exploit.

-Risk Mitigation: By identifying vulnerabilities in web applications, the script enables developers and security teams to prioritize and address the identified issues, reducing the risk of successful attacks.

-Compliance Verification: The script can assist in verifying compliance with security standards and guidelines, such as the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and others.

-Penetration Testing: It aids in conducting penetration tests by automating the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.

-Continuous Security Monitoring: The script enables regular and automated scanning of web applications to detect new vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that may arise over time.

-Security Best Practices: It promotes adherence to security best practices by identifying common security flaws and providing recommendations for improving the security posture of web applications.

-Time and Resource Efficiency: The script saves time and effort by automating the vulnerability scanning process, allowing for comprehensive testing of web applications in a shorter time frame.

-Customization and Extensibility: The script provides a foundation that can be customized and extended to meet specific requirements and incorporate additional scanning techniques or checks.

-Awareness and Education: The script helps raise awareness about common web application vulnerabilities and encourages developers and security professionals to understand and address these issues.

## Instructions üìù

### Step 1:

    Save the Script: Save the script code provided earlier in a file with the desired name, such as web_application_scanner.py. Make sure to save it with the .py extension, indicating that it is a Python script.

### Step 2:

    Install Dependencies: Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. In this case, the script relies on the requests library and the BeautifulSoup library. You can install them using the pip package manager. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following commands:

    pip install requests
    pip install beautifulsoup4

### Step 3:

    Provide Target URL: Identify the target URL of the web application you want to scan. Update the target_url variable in the script with the appropriate URL.

### Step 4:

    Run the Script: Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and run the following command:

    python web_application_scanner.py

### Step 5:

    Observe the Output: The script will start scanning the web application by sending requests and analyzing the responses. It will print out any identified vulnerabilities or issues as it progresses. You can monitor the output in the command prompt or terminal to see the results of the scan.

### Step 6:

Analyze the Results: Once the script completes the scanning process, review the output and the generated report (if applicable). Take note of the identified vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, and consider appropriate actions to address them.
