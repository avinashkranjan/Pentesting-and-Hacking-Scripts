Sniffing or network packet sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing all the packets passing through a given network using sniffing tools. It is a form wherein, we can “tap phone wires” and get to know the conversation. It is also called wiretapping and can be applied to the computer networks.

There is so much possibility that if a set of enterprise switch ports is open, then one of their employees can sniff the whole traffic of the network. Anyone in the same physical location can plug into the network using Ethernet cable or connect wirelessly to that network and sniff the total traffic.

In other words, Sniffing allows you to see all sorts of traffic, both protected and unprotected. In the right conditions and with the right protocols in place, an attacking party may be able to gather information that can be used for further attacks or to cause other issues for the network or system owner.
