# Ignite DumpsterFire:

"Ignite DumpsterFire" refers to the process of executing a created or configured DumpsterFire. In the context of the DumpsterFire Toolset, a DumpsterFire is a collection of Fire modules (small scripts or plugins) that simulate security incidents or attacks. The DumpsterFire Toolset allows users to build, configure, and save these sequences of Fire modules and then execute them as a coherent and timed sequence.
When you "ignite" a DumpsterFire, the toolset will start executing the Fire modules in the configured order, with any specified time delays between them. It provides date-time stamped feedback on each Fire's status and critical events during the execution. This allows users to track the progress of the DumpsterFire, coordinate events, and analyze the results.

The purpose of igniting a DumpsterFire is to test and validate security defenses and incident response procedures in a controlled environment. It helps organizations assess their security readiness, identify vulnerabilities, and improve their incident response capabilities.

# Dynamic Fire Modules:

The concept of "Dynamic Fire Modules" in the DumpsterFire Toolset refers to the ability to create custom Fire modules on the fly or dynamically. Each Fire module in the DumpsterFire Toolset represents a specific simulated security incident or attack. Users can define new Fire modules to mimic different attack scenarios or security incidents.
With dynamic Fire modules, the DumpsterFire Toolset allows users to configure and customize the behavior of each Fire module. When building a DumpsterFire, users can select the desired Fire modules and, if necessary, provide additional parameters or configuration data specific to that Fire module.

By using dynamic Fire modules, the DumpsterFire Toolset becomes more versatile and adaptable to various security testing scenarios. Users can define new Fire modules tailored to their organization's unique environment, applications, and security configurations.

Overall, the DumpsterFire Toolset empowers users to conduct comprehensive and realistic security assessments by igniting DumpsterFires composed of customizable Fire modules, leading to a more effective and practical testing and learning experience for security teams and organizations.

## Modules

Each Fire module typically represents a specific security event or attack and can be customized to suit different scenarios. Some possible examples of Fire modules could include:

- PhishingAttack: Simulates a phishing email sent to a target, triggering the user to click a malicious link.
- CredentialTheft: Mimics an attacker stealing credentials through a keylogger or other means.
- DataExfiltration: Simulates data being exfiltrated from the organization's network to an external location.
- RansomwareInfection: Represents a ransomware attack that encrypts files and demands a ransom for decryption.
- DDoSAttack: Simulates a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against the organization's web server.
- CommandExecution: Mimics an attacker gaining remote access and executing arbitrary commands.
- BruteForceAttack: Represents an attempt to guess passwords through brute force methods.
- NetworkScan: Simulates an attacker scanning the network for vulnerabilities.
- MalwareDelivery: Mimics the delivery of malware to the target's system through various means.
