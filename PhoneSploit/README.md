# PhoneSploit Pro

### PhoneSploit with Metasploit Integration.

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-v3.10%2B-blue)

An all-in-one hacking tool written in `Python` to remotely exploit Android devices using `ADB` (Android Debug Bridge) and `Metasploit-Framework`.

#### Complete Automation to get a Meterpreter session in One Click

This tool can automatically **Create**, **Install**, and **Run** payload on the target device using **Metasploit-Framework** and **ADB** to completely hack the Android Device in one click if the device has open ADB port `TCP 5555`.

The goal of this project is to make penetration testing on Android devices easy. Now you don't have to learn commands and arguments, PhoneSploit Pro does it for you. Using this tool, you can test the security of your Android devices easily.

> **PhoneSploit Pro** can also be used as a complete ADB Toolkit to perform various operations on Android devices over Wi-Fi as well as USB.

# Tutorial

## Setting up Android Phone for the first time

- **Enabling the Developer Options**

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Go to `About Phone`.
3. Find `Build Number`.
4. Tap on `Build Number` 7 times.

6. The `Developer options` menu will now appear in your Settings menu.

- **Enabling USB Debugging**

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Go to `System` > `Developer options`.
3. Scroll down and Enable `USB debugging`.

- **Connecting with Computer**

1. Connect your Android device and `adb` host computer to a common Wi-Fi network.
2. Connect the device to the host computer with a USB cable.
3. Open a terminal in the computer and enter the following command :

```
adb devices
```

4. A pop-up will appear in the Android phone when you connect your phone to a new PC for the first time : `Allow USB debugging?`.
5. Click on `Always allow from this computer` check-box and then click `Allow`.
6. Then in the terminal enter the following command :
