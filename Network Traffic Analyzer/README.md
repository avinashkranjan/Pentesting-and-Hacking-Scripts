## Instructions üìù

### Step 1:

    Save the script: Save the Python script with a suitable name, such as network_traffic_analyzer.py, on your local machine.

### Step 2:

    Install dependencies: Ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies, such as pcapy and dpkt. You can install these dependencies using the pip package manager. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following commands:

    pip install pcapy
    pip install dpkt

### Step 3:

    Set the network interface: Determine the network interface on which you want to capture network traffic. Examples of network interfaces could be eth0, en0, wlan0, or Wi-Fi. Modify the capture_packets('eth0') line in the script to use the appropriate

### Step 4:

    Run the script: Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and run the following command:

    python network_traffic_analyzer.py

### Step 5:

Observe the output: The script will start capturing network packets on the specified network interface and print the extracted packet information. You can monitor the output in the command prompt or terminal to see the source IP, destination IP, and protocol of each captured packet.

To stop the script, you can press Ctrl+C in the command prompt or terminal.
