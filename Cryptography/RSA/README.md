# RSA

The RSA algorithm is a widely used encryption and decryption algorithm in public-key cryptography

RSA is based on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers and modular arithmetic. It involves the use of a public key and a private key, which are mathematically related but computationally difficult to reverse-engineer

1.  Key Generation:

    - Select two distinct prime numbers, p and q.
    - Compute the modulus, n = p \* q.
    - Compute the Euler's totient function of n, φ(n) = (p - 1) \* (q - 1).
    - Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1. This is the public exponent.
    - Compute the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo φ(n). This is the private exponent, d.

    The public key is (e, n), and the private key is (d, n).

2.  Encryption:

    - Convert the plaintext message into a numeric representation, typically using ASCII or Unicode values.
    - Apply the encryption function, C = M^e mod n, where C is the ciphertext and M is the plaintext.

3.  Decryption:

    - Apply the decryption function, M = C^d mod n, where M is the original plaintext and C is the ciphertext.
