# STEWS: Security Testing and Enumeration of WebSockets

![STEWS cauldron image](stews-image.jpg)

STEWS is a tool suite for security testing of WebSockets

This research was first presented at
[OWASP Global AppSec US 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMFP71UAbPo)

## Features

STEWS provides the ability to:

- **Discover**: find WebSockets endpoints on the web by testing a list of domains
- **Fingerprint**: determine what WebSockets server is running on the endpoint
- **Vulnerability Detection**: test whether the WebSockets server is vulnerable to a known WebSockets vulnerability

The included whitepaper in this repository provides further details of
the research undertaken.
The included slide deck was presented at OWASP AppSec US 2021.

## Installation & Usage

Each portion of STEWS (discovery, fingerprinting, vulnerability detection)
has separate instructions. Please see the README in each respective folder.

### WebSocket Discovery

See the [discovery README](discovery/README.md)

### WebSocket Fingerprinting

See the [fingerprinting README](fingerprint/README.md)

### WebSocket Vulnerability Detection

See the [vulnerability detection README](vuln-detect/README.md)

## Why this tool?

WebSocket servers have been largely ignored in security circles.
This is partially due to three hurdles that have not been clearly
addressed for WebSocket endpoints:

1. Discovery
2. Enumeration/fingerprinting
3. Vulnerability detecting

STEWS attempts to address these three points. A custom tool was required
because there is a distinct lack of support for manually configured WebSocket
testing in current security testing tools:

1. There is a general lack of supported and scriptable WebSocket security testing tools
   (for example, NCC's unsupported [wssip tool](https://github.com/nccgroup/wssip/issues),
   [nuclei's lack of WebSocket support](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/issues/539),
   and [nmap's lack of WebSocket support](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2015/q1/134))
2. Burp Suite lacks support for WebSocket extensions (for example, see [this PortSwigger forum thread](https://forum.portswigger.net/thread/websockets-api-support-c8e1660b9f0ab) and [this one](https://forum.portswigger.net/thread/websocket-api-07e77f9ee3dd58552eb770)).
3. There is a lack of deeper WebSocket-specific security research (the [Awesome WebSocket Security repository](https://github.com/PalindromeLabs/awesome-websocket-security) lists published WebSockets security research)
4. The proliferation of WebSockets around the modern web (as seen in the results
   of the STEWS discovery tool)
