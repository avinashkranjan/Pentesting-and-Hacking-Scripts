# Wireless Network Crack Script

This is a Python script that provides a menu-driven interface for performing wireless network reconnaissance and cracking tasks. The script utilizes various command-line tools such as `subprocess`, `airodump-ng`, `macchanger`, `reaver`, and `wash`.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- `subprocess`: This module is part of the Python standard library and is used for executing shell commands.
- `airodump-ng`: A command-line tool for capturing wireless packets and performing network analysis.
- `macchanger`: A utility for manipulating MAC addresses of network interfaces.
- `reaver`: A tool for testing the security of WPS-enabled wireless networks.
- `wash`: A utility for scanning and identifying WPS-enabled wireless access points.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python wireless_crack_script.py
   ```

4. The script will display a menu with different options for performing wireless network tasks. Select the desired option by entering the corresponding number.

5. Follow the prompts and provide the required information for each selected option.

6. The script will execute the chosen functionality using the appropriate command-line tools and display the output or perform the specified actions.

7. Use the menu options to navigate through different tasks or exit the script.

## Options

1. Spoof MAC Address: This option allows you to change the MAC address of a specified network interface.

2. Start Monitor Mode: This option enables monitor mode on a specified network interface.

3. Stop Monitor Mode: This option stops monitor mode on a specified network interface.

4. Sniff Wireless Network (WEP/WPA/WPA2): This option captures packets from wireless networks using WEP, WPA, or WPA2 encryption.

5. Wireless Packet Capture: This option captures wireless packets from a specific access point (AP) and saves them as a ".cap" file.

6. Deauthentication Attack: This option performs a deauthentication attack on a specified access point and client MAC address.

7. Wordlist Attack To Crack the PSK: This option performs a wordlist attack to crack the pre-shared key (PSK) of a captured handshake packet.

8. Sniff WPS Network: This option sniffs for access points with Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) enabled.

9. PIN Attack WPS: This option performs a PIN attack on a specified WPS-enabled access point to recover the WPS PIN and gain access to the network.
