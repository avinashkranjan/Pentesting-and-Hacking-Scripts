# Crossfire POC

The script provided is a basic port scanning script written in Python. Its purpose is to scan a target IP address for open or closed ports. Here are the main points regarding the script and its purpose:

-The script utilizes the socket module in Python to create TCP socket connections.
-It takes a target IP address and a list of ports as inputs.
-The scan_port function attempts to connect to each port on the specified IP address using a TCP socket.
-If the connection is successful (port is open), it prints that the port is open. Otherwise, it prints that the port is closed.
-The scan_ports function calls the scan_port function for each port in the provided list.
-The script scans the target IP address for open or closed ports by calling the scan_ports function with the target IP and port list.
-The script is intended to provide a basic vulnerability assessment by identifying open ports that may be potential entry points for security threats.

## Instructions üìù

### Step 1:

    Set up Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Step 2:

    Create a new Python file: Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice and create a new file.

### Step 3:

    Copy the script: Copy the entire script provided earlier in this conversation and paste it into the newly created file.

### Step 4:

    Customize the target IP and ports: Modify the target_ip variable to specify the IP address you want to scan. You can also customize the ports list to include the ports you want to scan.

### Step 5:

    Save the file: Save the file with a .py extension, such as vulnerability_scan.py, in a location of your choice.

### Step 6:

    Open a terminal or command prompt: Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

### Step 7:

    Navigate to the script's directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script.

### Step 8:

    Run the script: In the terminal or command prompt, enter the following command to run the script:

    python vulnerability_scan.py

    Make sure to replace vulnerability_scan.py with the actual name of your script if you chose a different name.

### Step 9:

    The script will start scanning the specified target IP address for open or closed ports. The results will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt window, indicating whether each scanned port is open or closed.
