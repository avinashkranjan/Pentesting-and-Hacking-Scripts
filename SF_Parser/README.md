# SpiderFoot Parser Python Script - README

## Description

This Python script, called "sf_parser," is a command-line utility for parsing and displaying data from SpiderFoot's JSON output. SpiderFoot is an open-source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool used for gathering information from various sources on the internet.

The script takes a JSON file containing SpiderFoot's output as input and extracts relevant information from it, presenting it in a tabular format. Each entry in the JSON file represents a piece of data related to a specific source and type.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following requirements met:

1. Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

2. The 'huepy' library for colorful output. You can install it using `pip3 install huepy`.

3. The 'terminaltables' library for creating tabular output. You can install it using `pip3 install terminaltables`.

## Usage

To use the script, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the script with the following command:

```
python3 sf_parser.py FILE
```

Replace `FILE` with the path to the JSON file containing SpiderFoot's output. For example:

```
python3 sf_parser.py /path/to/spiderfoot_output.json
```

## Output

The script will parse the JSON file and display the extracted data in a tabular format. The table will include three columns:

1. **SOURCE**: The source of the data, indicating where it was obtained from.

2. **TYPE**: The type of data, specifying the category or classification of the information.

3. **DATA**: The actual content of the data.

Each entry from the JSON file will be represented as a row in the table, making it easy to view and analyze the extracted information.

## Example

Assuming you have a JSON file named "spiderfoot_output.json" with SpiderFoot's results, you can use the following command to parse and display the data:

```
python3 sf_parser.py spiderfoot_output.json
```

The script will read the JSON file, extract the relevant information, and present it in a tabular format.

## Note

- This script is designed to work specifically with SpiderFoot's JSON output. Ensure that you provide a valid JSON file generated by SpiderFoot to avoid any parsing errors.

- The script only displays the data from the JSON file and does not modify or process it further.
