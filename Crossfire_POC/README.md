# Crossfire POC

- The purpose of this script is to demonstrate a proof of concept for a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Crossfire game.
- Buffer overflow is a type of software vulnerability where an attacker can overwrite a buffer's boundary and manipulate the program's memory.
- In this case, the script creates a specially crafted buffer containing a sequence of characters ("A") and sends it to the Crossfire game server running on the local machine.
- The buffer is constructed with a length of 4379 characters, consisting of the hexadecimal representation of the character "A" ("\x41").
- The buffer is then appended with additional characters ("\x90\x00#") which may serve various purposes depending on the specific exploit.
- The "\x90" characters often represent NOP (No Operation) instructions, and the "\x00" and "#" characters could be used for further exploitation.
- When the buffer is sent to the server using a socket connection, it aims to trigger a buffer overflow in the Crossfire game server, potentially causing the server to crash or allowing the attacker to execute malicious code.
- This script outputs messages to indicate the process of sending the buffer and receiving the response from the server.

## Instructions üìù

### Step 1:

    Open a terminal or command prompt: Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

### Step 2:

    Navigate to the script directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
    For example, if the script is saved on your desktop, you can use the command cd Desktop to navigate to the desktop directory.

### Step 3:

    Run the script: Once you're in the correct directory, execute the script by running the command python crossfire_exploit.py in the terminal or command prompt.

### Step 4:

    Observe the output: The script will start running and print messages indicating the progress of sending the buffer and receiving the response from the server.
    It will also display any data received from the server after sending the payload.
