# RapidScan v1.2 - The Multi-Tool Web Vulnerability Scanner

RapidScan has been ported to Python3 i.e. v1.2. The Python2.7 codebase is available on v1.1 releases section. Download and use it if you still haven't upgraded to Python 3. Kindly note that the v1.1 (Python2.7) will not be enhanced further.

Evolution:
It is quite a fuss for a pentester to perform binge-tool-scanning (running security scanning tools one after the other) sans automation. Unless you are a pro at automating stuff, it is a herculean task to perform binge-scan for each and every engagement. The ultimate goal of this program is to solve this problem through automation; viz. running multiple scanning tools to discover vulnerabilities, effectively judge false-positives, collectively correlate results and saves precious time; all these under one roof.

Enter RapidScan.
