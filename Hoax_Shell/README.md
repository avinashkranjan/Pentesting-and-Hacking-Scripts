# Hoaxshell

Hoaxshell is a fun command-line interface (CLI) tool that imitates a shell environment by providing a fake shell prompt. It allows users to type commands that produce humorous or misleading outputs, creating a simulated shell experience for entertainment and educational purposes.

## How it works

The hoaxshell tool is written in Python and built using the Click library to create the CLI. It utilizes a dictionary to map commands to fake output or error messages, giving the appearance of a real shell. The tool is fully customizable, allowing you to add your own commands and responses to prank your friends or use it as a teaching aid.
